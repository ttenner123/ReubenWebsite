# ReubenWebsite
Website for Reuben.

Steps to completion
1. Get a basic template (Navigation bar for easy access to the different parts of the site, etc.)
    - Examine sites of other people running for political office to get a view on what is typical
    - Keep it flexible - Make it do the basic things Reuben and I talked about (I'll e-mail you (Mason) a copy of our conversation for what he wants to have implemented) but should be able to be easily adjusted as he figures out what he wants on his website.
2. Get it set up as a SPA (Single-Page Application) - Thomas is planning on doing that this evening.
3. Make it look pretty!
