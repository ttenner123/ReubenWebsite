              <h2 class="display-4">About Me</h2>
              <p>I grew up in rural Minnesota on a 1000 acre crop/ 100 head beef farm.  I was active in 4-H and FFA, obtaining my National FFA Degree.
                In 1993 I moved to River Falls to attend UWRF and fell in love with Western Wisconsin.  There I met my wife Carrie, and had three wonderful children
                who all attend school in the district.  Since 2002 I have run my own small business, Digital Brigade.
                We have a shop on main street River Falls and do IT service work in 5 states.</p>
              <p>I’m a strong believer in exceptional education programs and protecting the amazing environment I fell in love with when I moved here 25 years ago.
                Having been both a farmer and a small business leader, I bring a unique perspective to the race for 10th District State Senate.
                I understand what it means to live and thrive in a rural area, as well as the challenges that running a successful small business brings.  </p>
              <p>I’ve been dismayed over the recent trends to defund both our college and K-12 systems.
                As a small business owner I know the best way to create good jobs is to have a well educated work force that can afford to go on to higher education.
                Massive corporate giveaways like the recent Foxconn deal are not a sustainable way to generate good jobs.
                We need to invest in a well educated work force as well as the small businesses (which are the main job creators) to keep our state economy healthy.</p>
              <p>We also need a great place to live to support the workforce, recent moves to sell 10,000 acres of public land and to relax
                environmental protections have a potential to destroy what we hold so dear about living here.
                Our clean rivers, parks, and public hunting lands are all in danger.  Selling off this land, or changing land use permits to allow for more
                mining are endangering our ability to hunt, ski, boat, hike and enjoy our outdoors.  Our outdoors are also a job creator.  Billions are brought into our economy
                each year by the recreation use of our public lands, over 140,000 jobs in this state are directly linked to our great outdoors.</p>
              <p>We need to support our local farmers.  Having been a farmer and an early adopter or no-till and rotational grazing I understand that our
                ability to make a good living farming and respecting our environment have always gone hand in hand.  The family farmer is the backbone of our rural
                economy and large corporate farms are distancing us further and further from our traditional farm values.
                I have a long history of working with the Farmers Union, 4-H and FFA.</p>
              <p>
                I’m a listener.  I make a living by listening to what is wrong with people’s computer needs.
                We seem to have lost our way to listen in this hyper-politicized world.  I’m not afraid to work across the aisle and listen to different viewpoints.
                I’m not afraid to change my mind based on solid facts, and good debate.  If elected I will take the time to attend any public meeting I’m
                invited to and not run from the hard questions.  I will not take money from large corporations and special interests.
                My job is to represent and listen to you, the people of the 10th District.</p>
